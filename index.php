        <p>A significant share of people is affected by disabilities and Widowâ€™s women in Bangladesh represent about a tenth of ever married women in the country. However, elderly people in Bangladesh also struggle to maintain a dependable income since finding employment is harder with age. Despite economic progress in Bangladesh, due to social stigma and patriarchal social norms, widows, disable people and elderly people tend to be highly vulnerable to poverty. Allowances for the financially insolvent disable, widowed or elderly people aim to provide poor disable, widowed women and old people with cash transfers to improve their socio-economic wellbeing. However, this web application we will made contain all information of allowances for disable, widow women and elderly people. They can log into the web application and see the amount of their allowance. It will also notify them (disable, elderly people and widow women) about their allowances and the date they can withdraw their allowance money.</p>
